# Research Object Crate API (RO-Crate-API)

[RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.

RO-Crate-API describes a REST JSON API that can be used to manage these collections in a way that abstracts the underlying object stores and search engines.

## Getting Started
