# Research Object Crate API (RO-Crate-API)

The RO-Crate API provides a standardised REST interface for accessing and
managing [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) collections.
RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to
packaging research data with machine-readable metadata, making it easier
to share, preserve, and reuse research outputs.

## What is RO-Crate?

Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) is a lightweight approach to packaging
research data with their metadata. It uses JSON-LD and schema.org to provide
rich, structured descriptions of research datasets, software, workflows, and
other digital objects. RO-Crate makes research data more findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

## Why an API?

While RO-Crate defines excellent standards for metadata packaging, institutions
need programmatic ways to:

- **Discover** research data across repositories
- **Access** metadata and files programmatically  
- **Search** collections with complex queries
- **Integrate** with existing research workflows
- **Build** applications on top of research data

The RO-Crate API specification addresses these needs by providing a consistent
REST interface that abstracts the underlying storage systems and search
engines.

## Key Features

### üîç **Powerful Search**

- Full-text search across metadata
- Advanced boolean queries
- Geographic search with bounding boxes
- Faceted search with filters
- Language and communication mode filtering

### üîê **Flexible Authentication**

- Public access for open data
- API key authentication for integrations
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for user applications
- Fine-grained access control

### üìä **Rich Metadata**

- Complete RO-Crate entity information
- Hierarchical collection browsing
- File access and download
- Conformance to LDAC profiles

### üöÄ **Developer Friendly**

- RESTful design following best practices
- Comprehensive OpenAPI specification
- Rate limiting with clear headers
- Detailed error responses with request IDs

## Current Implementations

The RO-Crate API is already in use by several major research data repositories:

- **[LDaCA](https://data.ldaca.edu.au)**: Language Data Commons of Australia
- **[PARADISEC](https://catalog.paradisec.org.au)**: Pacific and Regional
  Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures

## API Capabilities

### Entity Management

- List entities with filtering and pagination
- Retrieve detailed entity information
- Navigate collection hierarchies
- Access files and media

### Advanced Search

- Free-text search across all metadata
- Boolean query support for complex searches
- Geographic search within bounding boxes
- Faceted search with dynamic filters
- Communication mode and language filtering

### File Access

- Direct file downloads
- Partial content support (byte-range requests)
- Configurable content disposition
- Location-based redirects for distributed storage

## Future Development

The RO-Crate API specification is actively developed with planned enhancements:

- Write operations (create, update, delete)

## Community and Contribution

The RO-Crate API specification is developed openly:

- **Specification Repository**:
  [github.com/johnf/ro-crate-api](https://github.com/johnf/ro-crate-api)
- **Issue Tracking**: Report bugs and request features
- **Discussion**: Join the RO-Crate community discussions

## Standards and Compliance

The API builds on established standards:

- **OpenAPI 3.1.0** for API specification
- **JSON-LD** for metadata serialization
- **Schema.org** for vocabulary
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** for authentication
- **HTTP Range Requests** for file operations
