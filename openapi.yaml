  title: RO-Crate API
  summary: A comprehensive API for managing RO-Crate collections
  description: |
    ## Introduction
    This API offers a standardised approach to interacting with RO-Crate metadata in repositories that host diverse media archives, such as PARADISEC. Building on the RO-Crate specification, the endpoints here facilitate the creation, retrieval, and management of digital collections, ensuring metadata is compliant and discoverable.

    RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) is a lightweight approach to packaging research data with machine-readable metadata. By using this API, developers and archives can programmatically interface with RO-Crate-compliant collections, enabling consistent handling of metadata and files.

    This documentation covers what a valid implementation of this API should look like.

    ## Authentication

    It is expected that most archives will allow public access but there will typically be entities which are private or require authorization.

    When authentication is required, an API implementation MUST implement OAuth2 and it is recommended that OpenID is also added for simpler configuration and discoverability.

    ## Rate Limiting

    API implementations MAY implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. When rate limiting is active, responses will include rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) and will return a 429 status code when limits are exceeded.

        ### Entity
        Retrieve and list the entities in a collection. This endpoint returns key metadata describing each entity (e.g., ID, name, description). The response can be filtered, paginated, and sorted, allowing clients to navigate large archives efficiently.

        ### Search
        Perform advanced or basic searches across the entire RO-Crate collection. This includes free text queries, as well as filters for specific fields such as `inLanguage` or `mediaType`. The search results can be paginated, sorted, and optionally returned alongside facet counts.

                  default: basic
                  description: Specifies the search method to be used. `basic` searches across common fields, whereas `advanced` can handle Boolean queries or more complex logic.
                query:

                  description: |
                    The query string used in the search. Behavior depends on `searchType`. For `basic`, this can be free text. For `advanced`, Boolean operators can be used.

                    When searchType is `basic` this is a free text field of text to search.

                    When searchType is `advanced` this is a boolean search field.
                    Examples:
                      name: John
                      name: John AND description: Engineer
                      name: John AND (description: Engineer OR description: developer)

                    NOTE: This API is implementation-agnostic. The examples above show basic boolean syntax that most search engines support.
                    API implementors may support additional query syntax - refer to your implementation's documentation for details.
